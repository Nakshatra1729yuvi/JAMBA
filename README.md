## 🎯 Overview

JAMBA is an innovative deep learning architecture that harnesses the strengths of both **Mamba** (state-space models) and **Transformer** (attention mechanisms) to create a hybrid model. This implementation provides efficient sequence modeling with improved performance on various NLP and time-series tasks.

The project explores the synergy between:
- **Linear-time Mamba blocks** for efficient sequence processing
- **Self-attention layers** for capturing complex dependencies
- **Hybrid design patterns** for optimal performance-efficiency trade-offs

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Motivation

### Why JAMBA?

Traditional Transformers have quadratic time complexity in sequence length, making them computationally expensive for long sequences. Mamba addresses this with linear-time complexity, but may miss some long-range dependencies that attention excels at capturing.

JAMBA combines the best of both worlds:

| Aspect | Mamba | Transformer | JAMBA |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n) |
| **Long-range Deps** | ✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ |
| **Efficiency** | ✓✓ | ✓ | ✓✓ |
| **Adaptability** | ✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ |

### Architecture Overview

The JAMBA architecture combines Mamba blocks with Transformer attention layers:

- **Mamba Blocks**: Provide linear-time sequence processing with state-space model capabilities
- **Transformer Attention**: Capture complex dependencies and long-range relationships
- **MLP Layers**: Add non-linearity and feature transformation
- **Hybrid Design**: Seamlessly integrate both components for optimal performance

The model alternates between Mamba and Transformer layers to balance computational efficiency with representational power.
